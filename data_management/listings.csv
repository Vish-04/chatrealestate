Proximity to great schools, restaurants, shops, parks, theaters, trails, etc.? Check! An extensive renovation completed in 2013, transformed 36 Edgewood from its vintage 1914 cottage roots into a stunning modern home. The main level features an open floor plan and large banks of windows that enable unimpeded enjoyment of dramatic views from every vantage point. The space is bathed in brilliant light and feels expansive and cozy all at once. The kitchen in back is stunning and wonderfully functional and has a wraparound corner window array that shows off the sun-drenched level lawn and vast patio areas that can be accessed via the rear door. The dining and lounge spaces are towards the front, with access to a lovely deck. The primary bedroom with en suite bath is also on the main floor, and downstairs is a comfy family room, 2 bedrooms, bath and laundry. 36 Edgewood feels like a wonderful retreat but is just minutes

Proximity to great schools, restaurants, shops, parks, theaters, trails, etc.? Check! An extensive renovation completed in 2013, transformed 36 Edgewood from its vintage 1914 cottage roots into a stunning modern home. The main level features an open floor plan and large banks of windows that enable unimpeded enjoyment of dramatic views from every vantage point. The space is bathed in brilliant light and feels expansive and cozy all at once. The kitchen in back is stunning and wonderfully functional and has a wraparound corner window array that shows off the sun-drenched level lawn and vast patio areas that can be accessed via the rear door. The dining and lounge spaces are towards the front, with access to a lovely deck. The primary bedroom with en suite bath is also on the main floor, and downstairs is a comfy family room, 2 bedrooms, bath and laundry. 36 Edgewood feels like a wonderful retreat but is just minutes

Marcus Stedman designed many homes between 1931 and the mid-1960s. He worked in a charming style reminiscent of Carmel cottages and the early California Ranch house, with Silvestre's Iron Works, of Allied Arts guild fame, to incorporate wrought-iron door hardware, light fixtures, fireplace tools, and screens. His skillful use of wood, hand-hewn beamed ceiling is wide and expressive with deliberate shadow lines. The doors are wide wood with some embellishment. This wonderful home still keeps its features.

This parcel must be sold and developed with the adjacent parcel which also has approved plans, 262 Castro St. This double lot development has architectural plans crafted by Geddes Ulinskas Architects and calls for the development of four residences totaling 7, 828 sq. ft.: a) two 3-bedroom condominiums at 1, 963 sq. ft. and 1, 787 sq. ft., b) one 2-bedroom standalone single family home cottage at 1, 680 sq. ft., and c) one 3-bedroom single-family home at 2, 398 sq. ft. The homes will include Downtown VIEWS as well as 1-car parking for each home. Roof decks, terraces, and gardens are included in the plans.

Located in a row of housing likely built around the same time, this building is no exception. The decorative aspect of the faade is an inset vertical rectangle, highlighted by color, which suggests a certain separation of space within. The current owners took the interior down to the studs and recreated a modern space, but this time with more open entertaining rooms, separated by an arch that mimics the kitchen island lights and back-splash tiles. The curves both disrupt and complement the angular lines of the interior. Two generous bedrooms overlook the rear shared yard with the spacious hallway bathroom having a mirror-like effect caused by the floor-to-ceiling tile on the right wall as you enter. On the garage level is a bonus space used by the current owners as an office with an updated half-bath, all permitted in 2010. The shared yard includes a common gas burner, grill and sink.

Located in a row of housing likely built around the same time, this building is no exception. The decorative aspect of the faade is an inset vertical rectangle, highlighted by color, which suggests a certain separation of space within. The current owners took the interior down to the studs and recreated a modern space, but this time with more open entertaining rooms, separated by an arch that mimics the kitchen island lights and back-splash tiles. The curves both disrupt and complement the angular lines of the interior. Two generous bedrooms overlook the rear shared yard with the spacious hallway bathroom having a mirror-like effect caused by the floor-to-ceiling tile on the right wall as you enter. On the garage level is a bonus space used by the current owners as an office with an updated half-bath, all permitted in 2010. The shared yard includes a common gas burner, grill and sink.
